        <h2>Taylor Swift</h2>
        <p>Back when we were still changin' for the better. Wanting was enough, for me, it was enough. To live for the hope of it all cancel plans just in case you'd call and say: "Meet me behind the mall". So much for summer love and saying "us" 'Cause you weren't mine to lose... You weren't mine to lose, no.</p>

            <h2>All to well</h2>
            <p>Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much, but maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up. Runnin' scared, I was there, i remember it all too well. And you call me up again just to break me like a promise, so casually cruel in the name of bein' honest. I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here 'Cause I remember it all. </p>
            <p>They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell every time, you double-cross my mind. You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine and that made me want to die. The idea you had of me, who was she? A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you.</p>

            <p>Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark. Show me the places where the others gave you scars. Now this is an open-shut case, I guess I should've known from the look on your face, that every bait-and-switch was a work of art. </p>

            <p>I persist and resist the temptation to ask you if one thing had been different, would everything be different today? We were something, don't you think so? Rosé flowing with your chosen family, and it would've been sweet, if it could've been me. In my defense, I have none, for digging up the grave another time. But it would've been fun, if you would've been the one.</p>

                    <h3>Cats</h3>
            <p>Taylor has three cats. Two of the cats are named after famous TV characters. The cats, Meredith and Olivia, are named after Ellen Pompeo's character in Grey's Anatomy, whilst Olivia gets her name from Mariska Hargitay's character in Law & Order: Special Victims. Taylor's third and newest cat is called Benjamin Button, after Brad Pitt's character in the film of the same name.</p>

                    <h3>Records</h3>
            <p>When Taylor's sixth album, 'reputation' was released in 2017, she became the only artist to release four consecutive albums which sold more than one million copies in their first week of release. In July 2023, Taylor's song 'Anti-Hero surpassed a billion streams on Spotify. Taylor also has three other tracks in the Billions Club - 'Shake It Off', 'Blank Space' and her collab with Zayn Malik, 'I Don't Wanna Live Forever'.</p>

                    <h3>Pseudonym</h3>
            <p>Taylor normally writes under her own name, but once she used the pseudonym Nils Sjöberg on Calvin Harris' song 'This Is What You Came For' featuring Rihanna. At the time, Calvin and Taylor were dating and it's believed that they didn't want their names to overshadow the song's release.</p>
